# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification

This google colab notebook applies the Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithm to a heart disease dataset (heart.csv) using Python and the scikit-learn library. The dataset includes various medical attributes of patients and a target label indicating the presence of heart disease.

The program performs the following two tasks:

- Task 1: It trains a Gaussian Naive Bayes model using only two features — chol (serum cholesterol) and trestbps (resting blood pressure) — to predict whether a patient has heart disease (target = 1) or not (target = 0).

- Task 2: It trains another Gaussian Naive Bayes model using three features — chol, trestbps, and fbs (fasting blood sugar) — to perform the same classification.
